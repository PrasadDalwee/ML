      "   The DGT 960 in new colors black and red is available from April 2013. This model will replace the original white/orange version. This handy foldable pocket timer is the first chess clock with a random Chess960 generator. Simply press the 960 button and a randomly chosen Chess960 starting position will be shown on the display. Next to classical chess, Chess960 is the only other form of chess that is officially recognized by the World Chess Federation FIDE. In Chess960 every game starts from a different position and the chess pieces are placed in one of 960 different possible starting positions. This idea of former World Chess Champion Bobby Fischer has been the most important improvement in chess in the last 500 years. With Chess960 players must start creative thinking from the first move as any knowledge about the theory of chess openings is not useless. Chess960 brings many chess lovers back to the chess board. \n",
